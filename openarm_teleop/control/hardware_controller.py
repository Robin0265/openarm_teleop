"""
Hardware controller for the physical OpenArm, without ROS.

Drop-in for OpenArmMuJoCoController in the teleop loop (set_joint_goals, q_current_right/left,
the mocap and SEW-frame helpers). Goals are wrapped and clipped to the joint limits, and the
command sent to the motors moves toward them at no more than max_joint_vel, starting from the
measured pose. A background thread reads the motor states and sends the commands at control_hz;
the MuJoCo model only mirrors the measured robot for the viewer and the solver.

A fault (motor error code, CAN bus error, motors that stop replying, or a tracking error that
stays above its threshold) holds the arm at its measured pose until the session ends.
